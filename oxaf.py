Draft abstract reproduced below:

A physically-based model of the ionizing radiation from active galaxies for
photoionization modeling

We present a new model of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) continuum emission
designed for photoionization modeling.  The new model {\sc oxaf} reproduces the
diversity of spectral shapes that arise in physically-based models.  We
identify and explain degeneracies in the effects of AGN parameters on model
spectral shapes, with a focus on the complete degeneracy between the black hole
mass and AGN luminosity.  Our re-parametrized model {\sc oxaf} removes these
degeneracies and accepts three parameters which directly describe the output
spectral shape: the energy of the peak of the accretion disk emission
$E_{\mathrm{peak}}$, the photon power-law index of the non-thermal emission
$\Gamma$, and the proportion of the total flux which is emitted in the non-
thermal component $p_{\mathrm{NT}}$. The parameter $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$ is
presented as a function of the black hole mass, AGN luminosity, and `coronal
radius' of the {\sc optxagnf} model upon which {\sc oxaf} is based.  We show
that the soft X-ray excess does not significantly affect photoionization
modeling predictions of strong emission lines in Seyfert narrow-line regions.
Despite its simplicity, {\sc oxaf} accounts for opacity effects where the
accretion disk is ionized because it inherits the `color correction' of
{\sc optxagnf}. We use a grid of {\sc mappings} photoionization models with
{\sc oxaf} ionizing spectra to demonstrate how predicted emission-line ratios
on standard optical diagnostic diagrams are sensitive to each of the three
{\sc oxaf} parameters.  The {\sc oxaf} code is publicly available in the
Astrophysics Source Code Library.

USAGE
This module may be used in two ways:
 1) Run as a command-line program to output the model spectrum to stdout:
        python oxaf.py E_peak Gamma p_NT
    Enter an incorrect number of command-line parameters to see the help string.
 2) Import into python (interactively or in a script) to gain access to the
    functions.  For example:
        import oxaf
        E, B, F = oxaf.full_spectrum(E_peak, Gamma, p_NT)
    Documentation for each of the functions is given in the function docstring.
    E.g. in ipython, "oxaf.full_spectrum?" will display help for this function.

The module may be used in python 2 or python 3, and depends only on the
standard numerical library numpy.

The module contains the following non-private functions:
find_E_peak        Calculate E_peak from M_BH, L/L_Edd and r_cor
disk               Calculate the oxaf model accretion disk spectrum      
non_thermal        Calculate the oxaf model non-thermal power-law spectrum 
full_spectrum      Calculate the full oxaf model spectrum: call "disk" and
                   "non_thermal" and sum the results using the weighting p_NT

See individual functions for further documentation.
